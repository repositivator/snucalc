            In recent oncology trials,
            <br>surrogate endpoints represented by progression-free survival and objective response rate
            <br>have primary roles. These endpoints are imaging-based outcomes assessed
            <br>through <b>RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors)</b> response categorization
            <br>according to the percent change of the tumor burden before and after treatment.

        <div class="well well-intro div-centered">
            However, radiologic measurements of baseline and post-treatment tumor burden may be inconsistent between readings. This application estimates <b>how the objective response rate would vary due to the measurement variability when the same or another radiologist re-assesses the tumor response.</b>
